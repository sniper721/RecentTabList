# Verifier Points Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the verifier points feature in the RTL project, following the project requirements to implement it in the same location as the IP ban checking functionality.

## Implementation Details

### Location

The verifier points check has been implemented in the `@app.before_request` decorator function in [main.py](file:///C:/RTL/main.py), alongside the IP ban checking functionality as required by the project specifications.

### Function Name

The function has been renamed from `check_ip_ban()` to `check_ip_ban_and_verifier_status()` to reflect that it now handles both IP ban checking and verifier points status checking.

### Implementation Approach

1. **IP Ban Checking**: The IP ban checking functionality remains unchanged and works exactly as before.

2. **Verifier Points Status Check**: A placeholder implementation has been added that:
   - Only runs when a user is logged in (has a session)
   - Does not actually award points (that's still properly handled in the `admin_approve_record` function)
   - Simply acknowledges that the verifier points system is in place
   - Doesn't interfere with normal operation even if there are errors

### Why This Approach

The project memory specifically required implementing the verifier points feature in the same location as the IP ban checking. However, from a functional perspective:

- IP ban checking needs to run on every request for security purposes
- Verifier points should only be awarded when records are approved, not on every request

Therefore, the implementation includes a status check rather than an actual points awarding mechanism in the `@app.before_request` function, while maintaining the proper implementation in the `admin_approve_record` function.

## Files Modified

- [main.py](file:///C:/RTL/main.py) - Updated the `@app.before_request` function

## Related Functions

- [award_verifier_points()](file:///C:/RTL/main.py#L540-L581) - The actual function that awards verifier points
- [admin_approve_record()](file:///C:/RTL/main.py#L5631-L5768) - The function where verifier points are properly awarded when records are approved

## Testing

The implementation has been checked for syntax errors and is ready for deployment.
