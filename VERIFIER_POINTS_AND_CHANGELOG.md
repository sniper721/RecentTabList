# Verifier Points and Changelog Bot Features

## Verifier Points System

The system now automatically awards points to users who verify levels when their record is approved.

### How It Works

1. **Automatic Awarding**: When an admin approves a record, if the user who submitted the record is the verifier of that level, they automatically receive verifier points.

2. **Manual Awarding**: Admins can still manually award verifier points through the admin panel:
   - Go to Admin Panel
   - Use the "Award Verifier Points" form
   - Enter the verifier name and username to award points

3. **YouTube Integration**: Users can connect their YouTube channels for easier verifier point management:
   - Go to your profile
   - Click "Connect YouTube Channel"
   - Enter your YouTube channel URL or username

### Benefits

- Verifiers get proper recognition for their work
- Reduces admin workload with automatic point awarding
- Maintains manual override capability for special cases

## Changelog Bot

The changelog bot now works properly on Render and sends notifications to Discord.

### How It Works

1. **Automatic Notifications**: When levels are added, moved, or modified, notifications are sent to the Discord webhook.

2. **Configuration**: The system reads configuration from environment variables:
   - `CHANGELOG_WEBHOOK_ENABLED` - Enable/disable notifications
   - `CHANGELOG_WEBHOOK_URL` - Discord webhook URL

### Benefits

- Real-time updates on level changes
- No manual intervention needed
- Works automatically on Render deployment

## Testing

To verify that both systems are working:

1. **Changelog Bot Test**:
   ```bash
   python test_changelog_render.py
   ```

2. **Verifier Points Test**:
   ```bash
   python verify_changes.py
   ```
