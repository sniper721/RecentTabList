# Custom Message Feature Removal

## Summary
The custom message feature has been completely removed from the webhook functionality as requested. The webhook will no longer prepend custom messages to changelog notifications, and the repeating custom message issue has been fixed.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Custom Message Logic from Webhook
**File: [changelog_discord.py](file:///c:/RTL/changelog_discord.py)**
- Removed custom message retrieval and prepending logic from the [notify_changelog](file:///c:/RTL/changelog_discord.py#L179-L185) function
- The function now sends messages directly without any custom message processing

### 2. Removed Custom Message Section from Admin Panel
**File: [templates/admin/webhook_settings.html](file:///c:/RTL/templates/admin/webhook_settings.html)**
- Completely removed the "Custom Message" section from the webhook settings page
- Kept the "Send Direct Message" functionality for sending one-off messages
- Restructured the layout to remove the "Custom Message & Controls" section

### 3. Removed Custom Message Routes
**File: [main.py](file:///c:/RTL/main.py)**
- Removed the following routes that were specifically for custom message functionality:
  - `/admin/webhook_settings/test_custom` - Test custom message route
  - `/admin/webhook_settings/custom_message` - Update custom message route

### 4. Kept Direct Message Functionality
The following functionality was kept as it's separate from the custom message feature:
- `/admin/webhook_settings/send_custom` - Send direct messages to webhook
- Webhook enable/disable functionality
- All other webhook settings

## Verification
All tests passed successfully:
- ✅ Webhook sends messages correctly without custom messages
- ✅ Webhook respects enable/disable settings
- ✅ Direct message functionality still works
- ✅ Custom message no longer repeats

## How It Works Now
1. When a changelog event occurs, the webhook sends the notification directly
2. No custom message is prepended to notifications
3. The custom message feature is completely removed from the admin panel
4. You can still send direct messages using the "Send Direct Message" feature

## Files Modified
1. [changelog_discord.py](file:///c:/RTL/changelog_discord.py) - Removed custom message logic
2. [templates/admin/webhook_settings.html](file:///c:/RTL/templates/admin/webhook_settings.html) - Removed custom message section
3. [main.py](file:///c:/RTL/main.py) - Removed custom message routes

The webhook now works exactly as requested - without the custom message feature and without repeating messages.
