# Profile Fusion Issue - FIXED ✅

## Problem
When viewing someone else's profile (e.g., `/user/username`), the page would show:
- ❌ Your own bio, name, and profile picture
- ✅ Their records (correct)

This created a "fusion" where your profile info was mixed with their records.

## Root Cause
The issue was in `templates/layout.html` where the template was overriding the `user` variable:

```html
<!-- PROBLEMATIC CODE -->
{% set user = get_user_by_id(session['user_id']) %}
```

This line was overriding the `user` variable that the `public_profile` route was passing to the template, causing the template to always show the logged-in user's profile information instead of the viewed user's information.

## Solution
Changed the layout template to use `current_user` instead of `user` for session-related data:

### Before:
```html
{% set user = get_user_by_id(session['user_id']) %}
{% if user and user.custom_themes %}
    {% for theme in user.custom_themes %}
```

### After:
```html
{% set current_user = get_user_by_id(session['user_id']) %}
{% if current_user and current_user.custom_themes %}
    {% for theme in current_user.custom_themes %}
```

## Files Modified
- `templates/layout.html` - Changed `user` to `current_user` for session data
- `main.py` - Already had correct logic (no changes needed)

## Verification
✅ Profile data separation test passed
✅ Different users show different profile information
✅ Records are correctly associated with the viewed user
✅ Session user data doesn't interfere with profile user data

## Result
Now when you visit `/user/someone_else`, you will see:
- ✅ Their bio, name, and profile picture
- ✅ Their records
- ✅ No more profile fusion

The fix maintains all existing functionality while properly separating the viewed user's data from the session user's data.
